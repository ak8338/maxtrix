Matrix in C

This program populates 2 â€“ 2X2 matrices with values. These are each a two-dimensional array.
Consists of two functions:
One function performs the multiplication of the two arrays using array indices like a[i][j]. 
And the other function performs the multiplication of the two arrays using pointer arithmetic like *(a + i + j*number of columns in a row). Passes the name of each array and the number of rows and columns.
